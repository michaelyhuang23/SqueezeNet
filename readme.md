### A Py-Torch Implementation of SqueezeNet

SqueezeNet was developed in 2017 by Iandola _et al._ It achieves similar performance as AlexNet with a much smaller architecture. It exploits ResNet identity block and squeezing operation used GoogleNet. Their [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07360.pdf). I created this repo because I thought SpueezeNet can serve as a good benchmark for ML techniques, due to its small size and decent performance.
